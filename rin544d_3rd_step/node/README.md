# nodejs-sequelize-tutorials/rin544d_3rd_step

## TARGET

This tutorial is the 3rd step of the [series](https://ultering.com/it4us/?p=2729) and its code evolves from the [2nd step](https://ultering.com/it4us/?p=2010).

The target is to implement a project using MVC structure, Object oriented implementation, DAO pattern, view layer with CSS and Bootstrap, etc.

The controller (the router) delivers to a business layer that accesses the persistence via DAO.

This step finalizes the creation of the database structure to support the persistent layer for real life.
