# nodejs-sequelize-tutorials/rin544c_2nd_step

This project creates the view layer using Express, ORM (Sequelize), stub, DTOs and design patterns, evolving from the 1st step.

The purpose is to create the view layer using data generated by a helper to populate the database.

Speed is key concern, so it goes faster using multiples development threads.
Suppose a small team (most cases in companies) where the team is split into frontend developers and backend developers.

Instead of waiting to finish the DAO layer, a helper may provide support to the frontend in order to offer faster results for the stakeholders.
